<h1>Methodology</h1>
<hr>
<p>3.1 Participants<br>The study involveda sample of university students from diverse degree programs. Participants wererecruited  through  convenience  sampling  methods  from  multiple  academic  departments  to  ensure representativeness. Inclusion criteria includedenrollment in undergraduate or graduate  programs  and consent to participate in the study voluntarily.Online survey was created using the Google forms and was shared through social media platforms and personal contacts in the academia community. <br><br>
3.2 Data Collection Procedure<br>Data was collected through self-report surveys administered electronically using online survey platforms. Participants were provided  with  a  consent  form  outlining  the  purpose  of  the  study,  confidentiality assurances, and their rights as participants. The survey comprisedvalidated scales and items to assess variables related to their average daily screen time, sleep quality, and social media usage and academic performance.Utilizing  a  sample  of  university  students  from  diverse  degree  programs,  this  study employed self-report surveys to gather data on participants' digital well-being practices and academic performance indicators,  such  as Grade  Point Average  (GPA). Through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)  analysis,  we  examined  the  relationships  between  digital  well-being  variables  and  student performance. <br><br>
3.3 Measures<br>The sleep qualityof the students was measuring using the Jenkins Sleep Scale (Juhola et al., 2021). The reliability of the scalewas found to be 0.80. One of the sample items was “I wake up feeling tired”. The Jenkins Sleep Scale is based on the LikertScale. It rangesfrom Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree. On the other hand, the Academic performance of the respondents was measured through the single item questionnaire. The item was “What is your Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)?”. The respondents entered their CGPAout of 4.0. The variable of Screen Time was measured through the single item questionnaire. The item was “What is your daily average screen time?”. The respondents entered their daily average screen time. The Social Media Use Scale (SMUS) (Wang et al., 2016) was used to measure the social media usage. The reliability of the scale was found to be 0.83. The sampleitem was “How often doyou use social mediato watch 
226videosor view photos?”. The Social Media Use Scale was based on the LikertScale from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree.<br><br>
3.4 Data Analysis<br>The normality analysis was conducted using Skewnessand Kurtosis. Only the variables of sleep quality and social media usage were subjected to the analysis since the other questionnaires were single item questionnaires. The  skewness  values  for both  variables  are  positive  (SMUS: 0.181,  SQ/JSS:  0.214), suggesting a slight rightward skew in the distribution of data for both variables, albeit close to zero, indicating nearly symmetrical distributions(Groeneveld & Meeden, 1984). Additionally, the  kurtosis values  for  SMUS  (0.436)  and  SQ/JSS  (-0.300)  are  within  the  acceptable  range,  indicating  that  the distributions are relatively close to a normal distribution(Groeneveld & Meeden, 1984; Mardia, 1970). </p>
