<p>The objective of this review was to examine the use and therapeutic potential of Lactobacillus strains in preventing and managing infections of the urogenital and intestinal tracts. Specifically, the study aimed to evaluate the role of dominant vaginal and intestinal lactobacilli in reducing the risk of bacterial vaginosis, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal infections, as well as to explore the mechanisms through which these probiotic strains contribute to host health.</p>
