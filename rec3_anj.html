<h2>Recommendation</h2>
<hr>
<p>Further research is recommended to clarify the molecular and immunological mechanisms by which probiotic Lactobacillus strains exert their protective effects, particularly given their relatively low abundance in the complex gut microbiota. Long-term, large-scale clinical trials are needed to establish standardized probiotic therapies and optimal delivery methods. The medical community is encouraged to integrate probiotic-based interventions alongside conventional treatments, reducing overreliance on pharmaceutical remedies for infection prevention and health maintenance.</p>
