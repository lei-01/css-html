<h2>Methodology</h2>
<hr>
<p> This study employed a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature focusing exclusively on reports of endophytes that produce antimicrobial metabolites. Data were collected on the taxonomic classification of bacterial and fungal endophytes, the plant families from which they were isolated, the types of pathogens inhibited, and the geographic locations of sample collection. Only studies providing evidence of antimicrobial activity were included.</p>
