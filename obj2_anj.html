<hr>
<p> The objective of this review was to compile and update published literature from 2006 to 2016 on endophytic microorganisms that produce metabolites with antibiotic activity. Specifically, the study aimed to identify endophytes capable of inhibiting bacterial, fungal, and protozoan pathogens of humans, animals, and plants, and to document the types of metabolites produced, their microbial sources, associated host plant families, and global distribution</p>
