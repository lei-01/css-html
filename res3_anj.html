<p>The findings indicate that dominance of Lactobacillus in the vaginal microbiota is strongly associated with reduced incidence of bacterial vaginosis and urinary tract infections. Specific strains, including GR-1, B-54, and RC-14, were shown to restore and maintain normal vaginal flora and inhibit urogenital pathogens when administered vaginally or orally. Additionally, strains such as Lactobacillus GG demonstrated effectiveness in preventing and treating gastroenteritis caused by bacterial and viral pathogens. These probiotic strains were also shown to colonize the gut, inhibit intestinal pathogens, and protect against infections in animal models.</p>
