<h2>Recommendation</h2>
<hr>

<p>The study recommends the use of 60%–80% hog waste organic fertilizer mixed with soil as an effective and sustainable alternative to commercial inorganic fertilizers. This practice supports organic farming, improves crop yield, and helps manage hog waste responsibly, especially in rural and community-based farming systems.</p>
