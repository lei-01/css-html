<h1>Methodology</h1>
<hr>
<p>A cross-sectional survey research design was employed in this study. The participants consisted of 336 medical students from King Saud University selected through stratified sampling. Data were gathered using a structured questionnaire that measured socio-demographic characteristics, personal traits, and study habit patterns. Academic achievement was assessed using the students’ grade point averages (GPA). The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistical tests to determine the relationship between study habits, personal factors, and academic performance.</p>
