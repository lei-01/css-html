<h2>Methodology</h2>
<hr>
<p>This review analyzed existing scientific literature on probiotic Lactobacillus strains, with particular emphasis on strains GR-1, B-54, RC-14, and GG. The methodology involved evaluating experimental, clinical, and animal studies that assessed the effects of vaginal instillation or oral ingestion of these strains on microbial balance, pathogen inhibition, gut and vaginal colonization, and infection prevention. Studies addressing proposed mechanisms such as anti-adhesion activity, bacteriocin production, hydrogen peroxide generation, and immune modulation were included.</p>
