<h2>Statement of the Problem</h2>
<hr>

<ol>
<li>Salinity stress is increasingly affecting agricultural lands worldwide, yet there is insufficient comprehensive synthesis of how tomato plants are affected by salinity at multiple biological levels.</li>
<li>Although individual studies have investigated specific traits or responses, there is a lack of consolidated knowledge on how salinity alters growth, physiology, biochemistry, yield, fruit quality, and gene expression in tomato plants.</li>
<li>Because salinity stress is expected to expand globally, farmers and researchers need clearer evidence and recommendations to develop cropping practices and breeding strategies that improve tomato tolerance to salinity stress.</li>
