<h1>Methodology</h1>
<hr>

<p>The study used a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with seven treatments, including pure soil, commercial inorganic fertilizer, and varying proportions (20%–100%) of hog waste organic fertilizer. Pechay plants were grown for 30 days, and growth parameters such as plant height, leaf width, number of leaves, weight, and root length were measured. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA to determine significant differences among treatments.</p>
