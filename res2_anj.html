<p> The review revealed that the majority of antibiotic-producing endophytes belong to the fungal phylum Ascomycota and the bacterial phylum Actinobacteria. These endophytes were most frequently isolated from plants belonging to the families Fabaceae, Lamiaceae, Asteraceae, and Araceae, although antimicrobial-producing endophytes were not restricted to these families. The findings also demonstrated that bioactive endophytes have been collected from diverse geographic regions worldwide, indicating a global distribution.</p>
