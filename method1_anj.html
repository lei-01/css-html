<h2>Methodology</h2>
<hr>
<p> This study uses a review-based and analytical approach, synthesizing existing research on fungal-mediated bioremediation. Emphasis is placed on studies that evaluate the ability of Penicillium spp. and other fungi to degrade or transform xenobiotic compounds under low co-substrate conditions, as well as their ecological role in pollutant removal.</p>
