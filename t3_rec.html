<h1>Recommendation</h1>
<hr>

<p>The review concluded that more targeted research is needed to develop tomato varieties with improved salinity tolerance by identifying key molecular mechanisms and stress-responsive genes. It also emphasized the importance of adopting appropriate agricultural practices — such as selecting salt-tolerant cultivars, optimizing irrigation strategies, and the use of biostimulants — to mitigate the negative effects of salinity on tomato growth and yield. These recommendations are crucial to sustaining tomato production in regions facing increasing soil salinization.</p>
