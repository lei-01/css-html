<h2>Methodology</h2>
<hr>

<p>The study used a systematic review approach. Relevant research papers published in the last decade were identified from major scientific databases (such as Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science). These articles were screened and filtered according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to select studies that specifically assessed the effects of salinity on tomato plants. Once selected, the studies were analyzed to extract information on how salinity influences tomato morphology, physiology, biochemistry, yield, fruit quality, and gene expression.</p>
