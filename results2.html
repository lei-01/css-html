<p>The results showed that effective time management was positively associated with higher levels of study engagement. Students who demonstrated strong time management skills exhibited better focus, motivation, and persistence in their academic tasks. Additionally, self-control and reduced mobile phone dependence were found to partially mediate the relationship between time management and engagement, suggesting that students who manage their time well are more likely to regulate their phone usage and remain academically engaged.</p>
