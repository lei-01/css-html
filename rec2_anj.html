<h2>Recommendation</h2>
<hr>
<p> Future research should focus on exploring under-investigated plant species and ecosystems to uncover novel endophytic microorganisms with antimicrobial potential. The integration of advanced genomic, metabolomic, and bioassay-guided approaches is recommended to accelerate the discovery and characterization of new antibiotic compounds. Additionally, further studies should evaluate the therapeutic and agricultural applications of endophyte-derived metabolites to address the growing challenge of antimicrobial resistance.</p>
