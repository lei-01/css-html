<p>The review showed that salinity stress significantly affects tomato plants at all stages of development. High salt concentrations in soil or irrigation water alter plant morphology — such as reduced plant height, leaf area, and biomass — and also impact physiological and biochemical processes, including water uptake, chlorophyll content, and the production of reactive oxygen species. Gene expression patterns related to stress tolerance mechanisms are also altered under salinity conditions. These changes often result in decreased yield and fruit quality, although in some cases moderate salinity has been reported to increase specific quality traits such as soluble solids. The studies collectively highlighted that salinity responses are complex and highly dependent on genotype and environmental context.</p>
