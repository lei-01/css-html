<h2>Results</h2>
<hr>

<p>Results showed that pechay grown with 60%–80% hog waste organic fertilizer exhibited the best overall growth performance. These treatments produced plant height, leaf width, number of leaves, and weight comparable to or higher than those treated with commercial inorganic fertilizer. Pure hog waste and pure soil resulted in lower growth performance.</p>
