<h1>Results</h1>
<hr>
<p> The findings indicate that fungi play a significant role in the natural remediation of contaminated environments due to their ability to penetrate soil and degrade complex organic and inorganic pollutants. Penicillium species, in particular, have demonstrated strong biodegradation capabilities with minimal co-substrate requirements, making them promising agents for cost-effective bioremediation processes. </p>
