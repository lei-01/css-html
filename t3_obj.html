<h1>Research Objectives</h1>
<hr>
<p>The primary objective of the study was to systematically review and synthesize current scientific knowledge regarding how tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.) respond to salinity stress. It focused on identifying how salinity affects the morphological, physiological, biochemical, yield, fruit quality, and gene expression traits of tomato plants, and to highlight mechanisms of salinity tolerance or sensitivity based on existing studies. The researchers also aimed to use a systematic method (PRISMA-guided literature screening) to collect and evaluate research findings from multiple databases to provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of salinity stress on tomatoes.</p>
